title: Introduction to Machine Learning with Climate Science Examples
---

This course demonstrates Machine Learning concepts with programming exercises. We use Google Colab as our programming environment. Please refer to the instructions below for how to download all course materials and set up your own Google Colab environment for this course.

To get all the Module 1 materials, download [this GDrive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VnOTsvSw5Dh4SJNJHtTdV5XhBiuyGXsm?usp=sharing). Next, unzip the downloaded file to expand the folder. You will see a folder titled `ccai`. The contents of this folder can be viewed and run as Jupyter Notebooks on your local machine if desired. To run the course notebooks from your own GDrive, upload the `ccai` folder *unzipped* to your own GDrive.

To open the assignment notebooks or the solutions notebooks, navigate to `ccai/course/notebooks` in your GDrive folder. If you have never used Google Colab before, right click on the notebook you'd like to open. Select "Open With"->"Connect More Apps". Enter "Colab" in the search bar for GDrive applications. Install Google Colaboratory. Then you will be able to open and run all the course notebooks with Colab!
