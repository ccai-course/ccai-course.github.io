## About

This course is created by members of the non-profit, all volunteer group [Climage Change AI](http://climatechange.ai/). We hope these course materials will help climate scientist, climate industry engineers, or anyone new to programming and machine learning learn techniques
for applying AI to Climate Change problems.

## Lecture

Lecture materials are available along with python notebooks in the course materials. Instructions for how to download course materials can be found on the [Modules](/modules/) page.

## Resources

Coming soon: Additional resources for studying AI + Climate Change.

## Assignments

In the course materials GDrive folder, "assignment" notebooks, notebooks with key concepts left blank for students to fill in, can be found in the `ccai/course/notebooks/assignments` folder. Solutions can be found in the `ccai/course/notebooks/solutions` folder.
