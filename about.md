## About

This course is created by members of the non-profit, all volunteer group [Climage Change AI](http://climatechange.ai/). We hope these course materials will help climate scientist, climate industry engineers, or anyone new to programming and machine learning learn techniques
for applying AI to Climate Change problems.

## Lecture

Lecture materials are available along with python notebooks in the course materials. Instructions for how to download course materials can be found on the [Modules](/modules/) page.
